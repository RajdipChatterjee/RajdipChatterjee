# Rajdip Chatterjee

I'm Rajdip, a 20 year old aspiring web designer and developer. I really enjoyed learning different web-based technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and am currently learning Javascript from Dr. Angela Yu.
I learned Java and Concepts of OOPs and also do competitive coding.

I am looking for opportunities.
Thank you!ðŸ˜Š
